# Completed Standardization Changes

We've implemented the following standardization changes to the `hive-bench` and `engine-bench` projects:

## 1. Post to Hive Functionality

- Added the `post_to_hive` function to the `engine-bench` project's `blockchain.py`
- Updated the `generate_post.py` file to use the standard `post_to_hive` function
- Modified `post.sh` to include the `-p` flag for posting to Hive

## 2. Shell Scripts

- Standardized `run.sh` and `post.sh` in both projects
- Added better environment checking
- Improved error handling
- Added exit status codes
- Made scripts more robust with virtual environment and .env file checks

## 3. File Naming

- Updated database paths to use consistent naming:
  - `hive_benchmark_history.db` for hive-bench
  - `engine_benchmark_history.db` for engine-bench
- Updated results and post file naming to follow the same pattern:
  - `hive_benchmark_results.json` / `engine_benchmark_results.json`
  - `hive_benchmark_post.md` / `engine_benchmark_post.md`
  - `hive_benchmark_metadata.json` / `engine_benchmark_metadata.json`

## 4. Command-Line Interfaces

- Standardized CLI arguments in both `bench_runner.py` files
- Aligned argument handling between projects
- Added default output file paths
- Improved benchmark summary output to use the same scoring approach

## 5. Project Configuration

- Updated `pyproject.toml` files to have consistent structures
- Standardized entry point names:
  - `hive-bench` and `hive-bench-post` for hive-bench
  - `engine-bench` and `engine-bench-post` for engine-bench
- Added development tools configuration to both projects

## 6. Error Handling and Version Checking

- Added Python version checking to both projects
- Improved error handling in command-line scripts

## 7. Account Parameter for Metadata Updates

- Modified `update_json_metadata` function in both projects to accept an optional `account` parameter
- Updated the bench_runner.py scripts to pass the account parameter from command line to the function
- Clarified in both READMEs that the `-a/--account` parameter is used for both history benchmarks and metadata updates
- Improved error messages when account information is missing

## 8. Documentation

- Created detailed README.md for hive-bench following the same structure as engine-bench
- Documented command-line options consistently
- Ensured documentation reflects all standardized features

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistency**: Both projects now follow the same patterns and conventions
2. **Maintainability**: Similar structure means changes to one project can be more easily applied to the other
3. **User Experience**: Users familiar with one tool will find the other intuitive
4. **Robustness**: Better error handling and environment checks in both projects
5. **Flexibility**: Support for different accounts when updating metadata without changing environment variables

## 9. Metadata Handling and Structure

- Aligned metadata structure between both projects
- Ensured that the `top_nodes` field uses identical structure (array of objects with `url` and `rank` properties)
- Fixed how the title field is handled in both projects (added by CLI, not in post generation)
- Made CLI scripts structurally identical in how they process and output metadata
- Standardized error handling for missing metadata fields

## 10. CLI Output and Logging

- Made CLI output formatting identical across both projects
- Standardized summary output with details on node count, top nodes, and performance metrics
- Used consistent logging format in both CLIs (`%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`)
- Fixed helper functions to behave identically across both codebases

## Pending Further Standardization

Some areas that could be further standardized:

1. **Error Messages**: Further standardize error message formats
2. **Testing**: Add a common testing framework to both projects
3. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD for both projects
4. **Code Style**: Apply a common code style guide across both projects with automated formatting

This standardization makes it easier to maintain both projects and provides a consistent experience for users of both tools.
