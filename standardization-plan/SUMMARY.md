# Benchmarks Standardization Summary

After examining both the `hive-bench` and `engine-bench` projects, I've identified several areas where standardization would improve maintainability and ensure consistent behavior. This document summarizes the key findings and recommendations.

## Key Observations

1. **Core Functionality**: Both projects serve similar purposes (benchmarking Hive/Hive-Engine nodes) but have differences in their benchmark tests due to the different nature of what they're testing.

2. **Code Structure**: The overall structure is similar, but there are inconsistencies in file naming, argument handling, and shell scripts.

3. **Missing Features**: The `engine-bench` project is missing some functionality that exists in `hive-bench`, particularly the `post_to_hive` function.

4. **Shell Scripts**: The `engine-bench` scripts are more robust with environment checks compared to `hive-bench`.

5. **Documentation**: Both projects have different levels of detail in their documentation.

## Recommended Standardization Approach

The recommended approach is to keep the core differences that reflect the unique aspects of each blockchain while standardizing:

1. **File and Function Structure**: Ensure both projects follow the same structure, naming conventions, and patterns.

2. **Shell Scripts**: Adopt the more robust approach from `engine-bench` for both projects.

3. **CLI Interface**: Standardize command names, argument handling, and help text.

4. **Documentation**: Align README files, comments, and usage examples.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling and logging across both projects.

6. **Parameter Handling**: Ensure parameters are used consistently across both projects, especially for account-based operations.

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Functionality**: Add missing functionality to `engine-bench` (particularly `post_to_hive` function).

2. **Shell Scripts**: Standardize shell scripts for both projects.

3. **CLI Interface**: Align argument handling and CLI behavior.

4. **Account Parameter Support**: Ensure account parameters are properly used for both history tests and metadata updates.

5. **Documentation**: Update documentation for consistency.

6. **Code Style**: Apply consistent code style and formatting.

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: Similar structure means changes to one project can be more easily applied to the other.

2. **Consistent User Experience**: Users familiar with one tool will find the other intuitive.

3. **Simplified Documentation**: Similar projects can share documentation structure.

4. **Code Reuse**: More opportunities to share code between projects.

## Conclusion

By standardizing these two projects while preserving their unique blockchain-specific aspects, you'll create a more maintainable codebase and provide a more consistent experience for users. The standardization plan provides templates and examples to guide this process.

The most important change is adding the missing functionality to `engine-bench` to match `hive-bench`, followed by standardizing shell scripts and CLI interfaces.
